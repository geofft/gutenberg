{{name}} is avaliable as a gem, working under Ruby 1.8...2.1:

    $ gem install gutenberg

Then you go to your project folder and say:

    $ gutenberg --init

It generates all the scaffolding: `book` folder, `context.yml` and `structure.md`.  
То generate `README.md`, you say:

    $ gutenberg

Now let's configure it for your project.
