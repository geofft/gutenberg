What for
--------

Using Gutenberg, you can divide your `README` into smaller parts for easier comprehension.
You can take your code constants and inject it right into your `README`, the version for example,
so you donâ€™t manually change your `README` after each release.

You can unleash your metaprogramming skills in `README`. You can take methods of some module and describe it.
You can build a `README` for your piece of code that writes itself automatically without any manual efforts.

It is just the same difference like between SASS and CSS.
