Get started
------------

{{name}} is avaliable as a gem, working under Ruby 1.8...2.1:

    $ gem install {{repo}}

You can use {{name}} in a project written in any language, not only
Ruby. It doesn’t matter. You must have Ruby installed, though. If you’re
on Mac, you already have it built-in. Otherwise, [install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

Then you go to your project folder and say:

    $ {{repo}} --init

It generates all the scaffolding: `book` folder, `context.yml` and `structure.md`.  
То generate `README.md`, you say:

    $ {{repo}}

There are options, you can get a list using `-h` flag:

    $ {{repo}} -h

Now let's configure it for your project.
