**{{name}}** dynamically compiles multiple templates into one README.

It generates static readme file from Mustache-powered plaintext files,
which link automatically. It has a built-in library of mixins module.
More on that later, now basic features and how to get it working.

It uses {{semver}} and [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io),
both are cool and I appreciate their usage.
