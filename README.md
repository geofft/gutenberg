Gutenberg
=========

[Documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/somu/gutenberg/master/frames)  
[Gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/gutenberg)

**Gutenberg** is a documentation lifesaver when you are writing a large README.

**Gutenberg** uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).

It has a lot of built-in mixins for your new README. Just use it.

It has a built-in task for Rake, so you include it in your Rakefile:

```ruby
require 'gutenberg/task'
Gutenberg::Task.new
```
